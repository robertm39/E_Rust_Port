# CASC-2025 and CASC-J13 benchmark matrix and resumable batch harness

Beads: `E_Rust_Port-9jt.2.1`, `E_Rust_Port-9jt.2.7`

## Decision

Accept the manifest, strict batch protocol, ignored-corpus transfer boundary,
and report generator as the reusable competitive-evaluation substrate.
Do not infer full-matrix results from the normal-runner smoke. The high-memory
provider gate passed on 2026-08-01; the expanded canonical 8,502-run acceptance
gate remains `E_Rust_Port-9jt.2.7` until both release contracts complete.

## Manifest result

The generated
[`casc_2025_manifest.jsonl`](../../benchmarks/casc_2025_manifest.jsonl)
reconciles every row of the 12 official category result tables with exactly
one local problem:

- 2,901 problems in 12 categories and eight divisions;
- 2,425 recursively inventoried axioms;
- 4,279 include directives with no missing target;
- 100 indivisible source families;
- 1,911 train, 533 validation, and 457 test problems;
- every category represented in every split without any family crossing a
  split; and
- manifest SHA-256
  `31c9a99e4b34b56352b3311f3efe5c97f728fd078783085e1811d83eec271f6d`.

The official CASC-30 corpus strips TPTP headers and publishes the problems in
increasing difficulty order. The manifest consequently calls its five
within-category bands an ordinal difficulty proxy and never invents numeric
TPTP ratings. SLH families come from the retained Isabelle theory path in the
`Names` header; other problems use the TPTP/entrant three-letter family.

## CASC-J13 manifest extension

The immutable
[`casc_2026_manifest.jsonl`](../../benchmarks/casc_2026_manifest.jsonl)
reconciles the official CASC-J13 ATP corpus with the published result tables:

- 1,350 problems across TNE 100, TEQ 300, FNE 100, FEQ 300, FNN 50, FNQ 100,
  and UEQ 400;
- 2,438 recursively inventoried axioms;
- 50 indivisible source families and a 935/229/186 train/validation/test split;
- exact per-problem, problem-tree, axiom-tree, and all 26 official CSV hashes;
- PRV retained as official context but excluded from the ATP problem set; and
- manifest SHA-256
  `939f8d03f0ceb0cbccd6377a01b605d84adeaa46e892a630513cccb82c825941`.

Every J13 ATP problem uses the announced 180-second wall boundary, eight
schedule cores, and 128 GiB memory contract. The ignored deterministic J13
transfer archive is 196,467,548 bytes with SHA-256
`ab89485b9d00b00e1098a3ab3184e47d10e59978320dca1f541480320e2a7fdc`.
The generalized archive tool derives its confined prefix and exact file counts
from the selected manifest instead of trusting a caller-supplied year.

The batch harness now supports session-only new-result and wall-time caps so a
large immutable contract can be safely checkpointed within the fixed-EST
high-memory allowance. These caps do not enter the contract and therefore do
not invalidate later hash-checked resume. `combined_report.py` preserves
release identity across overlapping problem identifiers and emits complete
per-release and combined coverage, overlap, status, time, and memory views.

## Runtime contract

[`batch.py`](../../tools/casc_benchmark/batch.py) runs one solver/problem pair
at a time in a fresh cgroup-v2 boundary. It measures aggregate CPU and peak
memory, enforces aggregate memory and PID ceilings, uses monotonic wall limits,
and kills the full cgroup after graceful process-session termination. It also
sets `RLIMIT_AS` in the child. SLH uses one core and an aggregate 15-second CPU
limit; wall-limited divisions use the official 120/240/480-second limits.

The immutable contract covers the manifest and selected-problem hashes,
presentation, binary hashes/revision, exact adapters, core/memory/PID limits,
Vampire seed, and optional source snapshot. Each session separately records
host and runner identity, allowing a compatible run to resume across guarded
Linodes. Existing results are skipped only after the JSON contract, problem
hash, and stdout/stderr hashes pass.

[`report.py`](../../tools/casc_benchmark/report.py) reproduces coverage by
category, division, family split, and ordinal difficulty band; classification
counts; time curves; wall/CPU/peak-memory distributions; overlap and unique
solves; status pairs; and proof/model polarity disagreements. It checks
terminal SZS statuses against independent category semantics rather than
treating either prover as an oracle. Every report warns that the checked-in
official CSVs are contextual and that this pinned local Vampire command is not
the official competition configuration.

## Ignored corpus boundary

The first smoke preflight correctly refused to run because the repository's
intentional `problems/` ignore rule kept the corpus out of source sync. That
preflight also found that the first manifest draft counted only 300 top-level
axioms and omitted 2,125 axioms in nested `ITP001` and `SET007` directories.
No solver executed in that attempt.

[`corpus_archive.py`](../../tools/casc_benchmark/corpus_archive.py) fixes the
operational gap without adding corpus bytes to Git. It creates a deterministic
regular-file-only archive, rejects absolute/traversing/link/unexpected
members, refuses overwrite, safely extracts, and then verifies all problem,
include, and recursive axiom hashes. The final ignored archive is 368,939,544
bytes with SHA-256
`efcebc55298d4c6770113c095e8cefdd77b9e8cbe3afa3078201f541893d1a7d`.
The normal runner independently matched that hash and verified all 5,326
files after extraction.

## Normal-runner smoke

Runner `e-rust-codex-260728-112514-c164` (run
`260728-112514-c164`, Linode `101605637`) used Ubuntu 24.04.4, kernel
`6.8.0-134-generic`, four exposed AMD EPYC 9845 CPUs, and 7,940 MiB host
memory. Source snapshot SHA-256 was
`6b106c2526ce8a3fb6846df4bb0e4ac6a4514fbaef92b14a069e2dd68ba3cc2b`.
The release Umlaut binary matched
`1f94c64f49c7efeaf50c7b96db6bc61791f817e0636ebcc2fa6bd7193c0624a8`;
the uploaded Vampire matched its pinned hash.

The deliberately noncanonical contract used four cores and a 4 GiB cgroup
limit on FNE problem `KRS203+1`:

| Solver | SZS | Wall | Aggregate CPU | Peak cgroup memory | Residue |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| Umlaut | `Theorem` | 0.108414 s | 0.113288 s | 30.542969 MiB | none |
| Vampire | `Theorem` | 0.261710 s | 0.245239 s | 5.484375 MiB | none |

The complete smoke report contains two of two expected results, one shared
solve, and zero polarity disagreements. Repeating the exact command produced
zero new results and hash-validated both existing results, exercising resume.
The ignored raw archive is 6,569 bytes with SHA-256
`93007b5f1b5e8de422d7516b20bc3d01112e02d4e1d040459c4341a2b551d43d`;
the tracked machine-readable digest is
[`smoke-summary.json`](smoke-summary.json).

The runner and firewall were deleted.

## Remaining acceptance boundary

This smoke validates program construction, separate ignored inputs, binary and
corpus hashes, cgroup accounting, SZS extraction, atomic results, resume, full
report generation, artifact transfer, and cleanup. It does not validate the
required eight-core/128 GiB environment or execute all 2,901 problems for both
solvers. The earlier `g7-highmem-8` provider restriction was resolved on
2026-08-01 when the guarded lifecycle gate passed. Gate
`E_Rust_Port-9jt.2.7` now preserves the full-run acceptance work itself,
expanded to the 2,901 CASC-2025 and 1,350 CASC-J13/2026 ATP problems. The J13
manifest, archive, and combined-report contract are now ready; the 8,502
solver/problem executions and final reports remain outstanding.
